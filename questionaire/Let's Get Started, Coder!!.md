\4. What is the difference between relative positioning and absolute positioning in HTML?

 

Answer: An element with `position: relative;` is positioned relative to its normal position.

Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

​	Example

div.relative {
 position: relative;
 left: 30px;
 border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

An element with `position: absolute;` is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

 Example

div.relative {
 position: relative;
 width: 400px;
 height: 200px;
 border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

div.absolute {
 position: absolute;
 top: 80px;
 right: 0;
 width: 200px;
 height: 100px;
 border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
